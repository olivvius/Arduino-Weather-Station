# Arduino-Weather-Station
This C++ code is for a  Weather station with Arduino MEGA board with various sensors:
temperature, humidity, soil humidity, luminosity, rain rate, wind speed, wind direction. 
The budget for all the hardware needed is around 120$.
The code and the weather station are curently working. The output are printed on LCD 16*2 screen but can be sent to an http web page through TCP/IP protocol if the Arduino board is connected.
The calibration of wind speed and rain rate has to be done.
